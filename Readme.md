===========

Development work for the 2014 design project curriculum for the Women in Engineering Summer Camp at Ohio State University.  This camp uses the [Sparki](http://arcbotics.com/products/sparki/) robot from ArcRobotics.  Students in the camp use the [Minibloq](http://blog.minibloq.org/) graphical programming language to perform various programming challenges with Sparki.  

This repository documents the curriculum for the camp as well as the modifications to more completely implement the Sparki functionality within Minibloq.

## Repository Contents

* `Minibloq/Examples`: Example Minibloq programs ported from the SparkiDuino examples
