1. Basic Code - does nothing, like it's supposed to
2. Variables
	1. Arrays - no support for arrrays or characters - can't store data or text, fine for less advanced applications
	2. Euler's number is not defined (no reason they'd use it, but it is a button)
	3. Numbers are float by default - might need ability to round - can work around it with greater than and less than
3. Functions
	1. Blocks are as close to functions as this goes. Everything is defined within setup(), so I guess that's okay
	2. Things might get repetitive, but I guess that's what looping is for
4. Controls
	1. Beep - no default value, that's fine, just have to specify frequency and duration
	2. Angry emoticon does not work
	3. While Loop and If statement are less intuitive, click = (or something else) to get more options
	4. No switch statements, can get around it with if statements
	5. IR sensor not implemented yet
5. Accelerometer
	1. No printline block (does newlines manually) - have to use print number for variables
	2. Includes gravity
